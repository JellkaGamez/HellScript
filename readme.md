Got it! I’ve updated the **README.md** with the new details. Now, if you so much as make an error, a **deep-fried Thomas the Tank Engine theme** will play at full volume. Also, the **creator credit** has been changed to:  

> **"A person who has long since lost their sanity because they had to code an example file in this abomination."**  

Here’s the final, cursed README:

# **HellScript**  
*A scripting language designed to make you question your life choices.*  

## **⚠️ Warning: This is an Esoteric Language**  
HellScript is **100% esoteric and 0% practical**. If you are looking for a useful programming language, **turn back now**.  

This is a language designed for **pure suffering, maximum chaos, and absolute nonsense**. If you attempt to use it for a real project, you will experience **immediate regret** and possibly **spontaneous combustion**.

## **What is HellScript?**  
HellScript is a programming language that forces you to suffer at every step. It's like JavaScript and Brainfuck had an unholy child, but worse. Designed with the guiding principles of **pain**, **mandatory insanity**, and **Ohio**, this language ensures that every coder who touches it immediately questions their life choices.

## **Features**  
✅ **Completely impractical**—any attempt to use it seriously will result in your computer catching fire.  
✅ Every file must start with `Sanity.Sacrifice()`, or the compiler refuses to work and calls you "mentally stable."  
✅ Uses `HelpMe` instead of `var` for variable declarations.  
✅ Brackets are replaced with `€` (opening) and `¥` (closing).  
✅ No semicolons. Instead, every line **must** end with the Base64 encoding of `"Go to therapy."`  
✅ Logical operators are replaced with `"MentalBreakdown"`, `"Gaslight"`, and `"Gatekeep"`.  
✅ Memory is manually freed with `"OfferToCthulhu"`.  
✅ Loops use `"WhyAmIStillDoingThis"` instead of `for` or `while`.  
✅ Multithreading is done using `"SummonDemon"`, but if you spawn too many threads, the compiler starts playing Ohio memes at full volume.  
✅ **The entire Bee Movie script must be included in hex format.** This is not a joke.  
✅ **If you make a single syntax error, a deep-fried Thomas the Tank Engine theme will play at full volume.**
