# **HellScript**  
*A scripting language designed to make you question your life choices.*  

## **⚠️ Warning: This is an Esoteric Language**  
HellScript is **100% esoteric and 0% practical**. If you are looking for a useful programming language, **turn back now**.  

This is a language designed for **pure suffering, maximum chaos, and absolute nonsense**. If you attempt to use it for a real project, you will experience **immediate regret** and possibly **spontaneous combustion**.

## **What is HellScript?**  
HellScript is a programming language that forces you to suffer at every step. It's like JavaScript and Brainfuck had an unholy child, but worse. Designed with the guiding principles of **pain**, **mandatory insanity**, and **Ohio**, this language ensures that every coder who touches it immediately questions their life choices.
