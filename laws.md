# **HellScript: The Laws of Chaos**

Welcome to **HellScript**, the programming language where sanity doesn't stand a chance. Follow these 15 laws, and your program might work... but probably not.

---

### 1. **Function Declarations**  
Every function must start with **Hell**.

**Example:**  
```hellscript
HellPrint("Hello World")
```

---

### 2. **Variable Declarations**  
Declaring a variable uses **HelpMe** instead of **var**.

**Example:**  
```hellscript
HelpMe x = 42
```

---

### 3. **Project Structure**  
Before writing any code, you must define the entire assembly structure in **x86 Assembly**.

---

### 4. **Sanity Sacrifice**  
The first line of every file must be:

```hellscript
Sanity.Sacrifice()
```

Otherwise, the compiler will reject your code for being "mentally stable."

---

### 5. **README.md in Hex**  
The entire contents of the `README.md` file must be included in your program, converted to **ANSI** encoding and then to **hex**. Remove any comment characters before including it.

**Example:**
```hellscript

```

---

### 6. **Line Endings**  
No semicolons (`;`). Instead, **every line must end with the Base64 encoding of "Sanity is useless anyways."**

**Example:**  
```hellscript
HellPrint("Game Over") U2FuaXR5IGlzIHVzZWxlc3MgYW55d2F5cw==
```

---

### 7. **Brackets**  
No `{}` brackets. Instead, use **€** for opening and **¥** for closing brackets.

**Example:**  
```hellscript
€ HellPrint("HellScript is pure pain.") U2FuaXR5IGlzIHVzZWxlc3MgYW55d2F5cw== ¥
```

---

### 8. **Error Handling**  
If you mess up the syntax, you will see this message:

**"Your code lost its sanity."**

---

### 9. **Garbage Worship**  
Instead of standard **function calls**, you now worship the **VoidOfExistence**.

**Example:**
```hellscript
HelpMe cursedData = "Why am I using this language?"  
VoidOfExistence cursedData
```

---

### 10. **No Comments**  
No comments are allowed in HellScript. Your code must be pure chaos.

---

### 11. **Only the Void Understands**  
Your code will run in **complete oblivion**. There's no hope of understanding, only suffering.

---

### 12. **No Libraries**  
External libraries are forbidden. You are on your own in the abyss.

---

### 13. **Garbage Collection**  
The garbage collector only collects the **waste** of your broken spirit.

---

### 14. **End of Code**  
Your code must end with **VoidOfExistence**, or it will be forever lost.

---

### **Compilation Error Message**

If your code syntax is wrong, you will face the dreaded message:

**"Your code lost its sanity."**
